title: Filter stories by date range

Sometimes you want to catch up on what happened last week. Or maybe you want to see what a site published during a specific event or time period. That's where the new date filter feature comes in handy.

You can now filter stories by date range, showing only stories newer than a certain date, older than a certain date, or spanning between two dates. This works on individual feeds and as well as on folders.

The date filter lives in the feed options popover, right where you'd expect it. Click on the options button in the feedbar and you'll see the new "Filter by date range" section with two columns: "Newer" and "Older".

Each column has a date input field where you can manually enter a date, or use the quick duration buttons for common time ranges. Want to see the past week? Click "1w" under "Newer". Want to see stories from a specific month? Set the "Newer" and "Older" dates to bracket that month.

Here's how it works:

* **Newer:** Show only stories published after this date (stories newer than X)
* **Older:** Show only stories published before this date (stories older than X)
* **Both:** Use both to create a date range, showing only stories published between two dates

The quick duration buttons (1d, 1w, 1m, 1y) make it easy to jump to common time ranges without having to manually enter dates. Click "1w" under "Newer" and you'll see stories from the past week. Click "1m" under "Older" and you'll see stories older than a month ago.

This feature is particularly useful when you're catching up after being away, or when you want to research how a particular site covered a specific event. Combined with NewsBlur's full-text search, you can now both search for topics and filter by when they were published.

The date filters work across all of NewsBlur's views - individual feeds, folders, saved stories, and the river of news. The filters don't persist between feeds, so you can set different date ranges for different feeds without the settings interfering with each other.
